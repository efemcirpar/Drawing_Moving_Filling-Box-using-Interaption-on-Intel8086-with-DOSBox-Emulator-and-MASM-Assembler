# Drawing/Moving/Filling Box Using Interruption on Intel8086 with DOSBox Emulator & MASM-Assembler

The implementation is based on the Instruction Set for Intel 8086 Architecture and can be tested using the DOSBox Emulator & Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM).

- 0 - Program redraws the rectangle as unfilled.

- 1	- Program redraws the rectangle as filled.
